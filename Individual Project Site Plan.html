7. CSS Files (Using Tailwind CSS and Optional Custom CSS)
This project will primarily use Tailwind CSS for rapid development and responsive design. All style classes will be applied directly in the HTML.

For more specific styles or complex animations that cannot be easily achieved with Tailwind, a custom CSS file (style.css) could be considered. However, for this example, we will rely on Tailwind.

<!-- In the <head> of the HTML -->
<script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
<style>
    /* Custom fonts */
    @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Playfair+Display:wght@700&family=Open+Sans:wght@400;600&display=swap');
    
    .font-playfair {
        font-family: 'Playfair Display', serif;
    }
    .font-open-sans {
        font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;
    }

    /* Custom Tailwind colors (extended configuration) */
    /* This would be configured in a tailwind.config.js file if not using the CDN,
       but for the CDN, they can be simulated with direct classes or CSS variables */
    :root {
        --color-primary: #8B0000;
        --color-secondary: #DAA520;
        --color-accent1: #2F4F4F;
        --color-accent2: #F5DEB3;
        --color-text-main: #333333;
        --color-bg-light: #F8F8F8;
    }
</style>
